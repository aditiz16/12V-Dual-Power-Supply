## Features

- Dual Output Channels :
   The power supply features two separate 12-volt output channels that can be controlled independently. This allows you to power two different circuits or components simultaneously, each with its own voltage and current requirements.
- Regulated Voltage :
  The output voltage is accurately regulated to provide a stable 12-volt supply, ensuring that the connected devices receive consistent power levels. This is crucial for the proper functioning of sensitive electronic components.

<!-- Applications -->
## Applications
- Electronics Prototyping
- Testing and Debugging
- Audio and Amplifier Systems:
  Many audio circuits and amplifiers require a stable 12-volt power supply. The dual channels can power both the audio input stage and the amplifier stage separately.
